# Traveling Salesman Solver

## Who is it for?
This would be useful for people such as traveling salesmen or visiting nurses.
When you have a bunch of places to go, but you don't particularly care which
order you visit them in, this will help you find the fastest way to go to all
of them.

## How does it work?
This project solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a distance matrix
derived from real-world data.

The interface allows you to enter `n` cities. Your inputs will be reordered
into the fastest route.
